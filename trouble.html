<p>Frogs are incredible amphibians that live on every continent except Antarctica. Their
smooth, moist skin helps them breathe through it.</p>

<h2>Life Cycle</h2>
<p>Frogs begin life as eggs in water, hatch into tadpoles, and grow legs as they transform
into adult frogs. This is called metamorphosis.</p>

attract mates.</p>
